The files in this directory are used to override the generated 'resource\_ids.auto.h' (etc.) so 
that we can use 'fixtures/font\_compression/system\_resources.pbpack'.

'fixtures/font\_compression/system\_resources.pbpack' was generated by adding the following stanza
to resources/normal/base/resource\_map.json:

    {
      "type": "font",
      "name": "GOTHIC_18_COMPRESSED",
      "file": "normal/base/ttf/18Cond.ttf",
      "compatibility": "2.7",
      "extended": true,
      "compress": "RLE4"
    },

and then rebuilding system\_resources.pbpack. See tools/update\_test\_system\_pbpack.sh for which
files need to be updated.
