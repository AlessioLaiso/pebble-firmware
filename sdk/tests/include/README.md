This folder contains tests for the .js code in sdk/include.

## Installing dependencies
1. `cd sdk/tests/include`
2. `npm install`

## Running tests
1. `cd sdk/tests/include`
2. `npm test` â€“ this runs the tests using the [mocha](http://mochajs.org/) test runner.

You should see some output, similar to this:

```
$ npm test

> pebble-pkjs-tests@1.0.0 test /Users/martijn/tintin/sdk/tests/include
> NODE_PATH=../include ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha *.js

## Linting the test code

1. `cd sdk/tests/include`
2. `npm run-script lint`

## Adding tests

* You can add `test_xyz.js` files in the `tests` folder. It will automatically get picked up by the test runner.
* If you need to a mock for the global `Pebble` object, check out `pebble-mock.js`. It's probably worth using and extending that than to re-invent the wheel.
* When adding additional dependencies (node packages), make sure to install them using `npm install --save-dev <PACKAGE_NAME>` so that they get added to the `devDependencies` in the `package.json` file.
